<H3>Hackaday's own Arduino-compatible AVR development board</H3></center>
<hr>

Under our new ownership, Hackaday is now able to bring you the latest and the greatest Open Hardware projects 
designed <i>completely in house</i>. For our first such experimentation in our own custom hardware, we decided
to build what we love: an Arduino-compatable development board that blinks an LED.<p>

However, after a cursory review of existing development boards, we were somewhat dejected; we realized everything
that could be done with a dev board had already been done. After some serious drin^H^H^H^Hthinking, the brains
behind Hackaday came up with an entirely new paradigm for what development boards can do.<p>

<H3>It's a freakin' bottle opener<H3><p>

Really, how sweet is that? I mean just look at this thing:

Actually, it's pretty sucky as a bottle opener. We ended up breaking the first one we tested. Nevertheless, in the
spirit of open hardware, we're giving out our files and hoping some of you can improve on it. Maybe you want to
remove the pin headers and replace them with LEDs? Maybe you want to make the bottle opener actually work. That's all
fine with us. just <a href="http://hackaday.com/contact-hack-a-day/">drop us a note on our tip line</a> if you build
your own.

Oh, the back silk screen is pretty sweet:
